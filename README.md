It combines weak learners into a single strong learner in an iterative way and can handle heterogeneous data; combine each model together by Logistic Regression, a linear model for classification problems. The results of every model and the offline test set are used as the input. After training we can get the blending model, which yields a binary output for each user-item record.

Analysis is done on 159,857 customers and 14 products, out of which 27% customers are labeled repeaters for some products (classimbalance ratio of 1:3). Features such as shown in Fig. 3, are extracted by our framework. Almost 100 features were selected to generate repeat behavior scores for selected customer-product pairs; To test the generality of our framework, we ran experiments on data provided by IJCAI-RBP 2 also.

The database comprises a subsample of approximately 100,000 members of a panel of over two million Internet users from across the United States. Members of the panel have software installed on individual machines in a household which passively captures all Web site visitation and online transaction activity. The smaller subsample is formed in a proprietary manner based on demographic variables so that it is a representative of the wider population of U.S. Internet users. The domain names of Web sites visited are recorded, along with the total number of page views (P) at each domain visited and the total duration (D) of the visit to a particular Web site. An indicator denotes whether each visit results in a purchase (B = 1), or not (B = 0)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Clickstream & Transactions           | X                      | -                      | -                      | -                      | handle of particular features with probabilistic classifier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Probabilistic Classifier         | multivariate stochastic model - Bayesian - quad-variate stochastic mode                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | -3.7% in RMSE for Amazon and -2.4% RMSE for Vic Secret                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The dataset contains anonymized user behavior logs and user attributes.24 Some records are shown in Table 1. The time span of the dataset is from May 11th to November 11th; the number of items in the data set is about 600 000, while the number of users is only about 30 000, showing a huge sparseness. This result shows that the purchase prediction for an item will be hard for finding users' behavior rules due to the sparseness. In the other hand, the number of brands in the data set is about 7000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Clickstream & Transactions           | X                      | -                      | X                      | -                      | feature engineering for time evolving features - evolving purchase behavior over time -  users' purchase intentions are different in different time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Classical Data Mining Classifier | Logistic Regression                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | promotion prediction 32% F1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Both datasets are reasonable in size - consisting of 9.2 million and 1.4 million user sessions respectively. These sessions are anonymous and consist of a chronological sequence of time-stamped events describing user interactions (clicks) with content while browsing and shopping online. The logic used to mark the start and end of a user session is dataset-specific - the RecSys 2015 dataset contains more sessions with a small item catalogue while the Retail Rocket dataset contains less sessions with an item catalogue 5x larger than the RecSys 2015 dataset. Both datasets contain a very high proportion of short length sessions (<= 3 events), making this problem setting quite difficult for RNNs to solve. The Retail Rocket dataset contains much longer sessions when measured by duration - the RecSys 2015 user sessions are much shorter in duration.

PAKDD has 22 million transaction records including 0.3 million impression records. The built model predicts whether a customer will click the given advertisement. Instacart has 2,06,209 users with 50,000 products, where the built model predicts whether a particular customer will buy a particular product. The model can be used for all products, to predict products in a customer’s basket for next order. The model is built on the initial data set in Startup Interface discussed in Section 3.1. We have extrapolated the impression records of PAKDD, to generate large number of impression records. These impression records are played as stream and fed to real time interfaces of iPrescribe. These records are sorted on clock time, so it simulates the behaviour of user clicks on transaction system. Similarly, test data of Instacart consisting of user records is simulated as stream to benchmark real time interfaces                                                                                                                                                                                    | Clickstream & Transactions           | X                      | -                      | -                      | X                      | real-time configurable system for buying session prediction based on ensemble                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Deep Learning Classifier         | iPrescribe uses ensemble of machine learning (gradient boosting, XGBoost [15]), and deep learning (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [26]) with optimisation to avoid having to store and process user-histories for every prediction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  AUC=0.67 and F-score=0.3843                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
